Welcome to the **Recruitment Prediction App** ‚Äì a powerful tool designed to predict whether a student will be recruited based on their academic performance and personal data. This app utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically a **Random Forest Classifier**, to provide insights into recruitment trends.

**How does it work?**
- The app takes into account key academic metrics such as SSC, HSC, Degree, E-test, and MBA percentages, along with gender, to predict whether a candidate is likely to be recruited or not.
- The model has been trained using real-world data to accurately predict recruitment chances.

**Why this App?**
- This tool is specifically designed to assist recruiters, HR professionals, and students in making data-driven decisions based on academic performance.
- The Random Forest Classifier has been selected for its robustness and ability to handle various types of data, ensuring high accuracy and reliability in predictions.

### Key Features:
- **Data-Driven Predictions**: Predict the recruitment status (Placed/Not Placed) based on multiple input parameters.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily input academic percentages and other relevant details.
- **Real-Time Results**: Receive instant predictions based on the latest model accuracy.

**Accuracy of the Model:**
The Random Forest model has been trained and evaluated on historical data, achieving an accuracy of **{accuracy * 100:.2f}%**, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting recruitment outcomes.

This app is built by **Tamoor Abbas** for the **Ineuron Project** and is a perfect demonstration of how AI can be applied to real-world recruitment challenges. Whether you're a recruiter looking to optimize hiring decisions or a student aiming to understand your recruitment chances better, this app is here to provide valuable insights.

Start exploring and see if you're eligible for recruitment based on your academic profile!
