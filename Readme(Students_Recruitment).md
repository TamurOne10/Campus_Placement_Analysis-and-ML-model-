Recruitment Prediction App - README
Overview
The Recruitment Prediction App is an interactive machine-learning application designed to predict whether a student is likely to be recruited based on their academic performance and personal details. It leverages a Random Forest Classifier trained on a real-world dataset to provide accurate predictions, helping recruiters, HR professionals, and students make informed decisions.

How the App Works
User Inputs:
Users input their academic performance metrics (SSC, HSC, Degree, E-Test, and MBA percentages) and gender using a user-friendly sidebar interface.
Prediction:
Based on the provided inputs, the app predicts recruitment status as either:
Placed: Likely to be recruited.
Not Placed: Unlikely to be recruited.
Dataset Details:
Users can explore the dataset structure and model details through a dedicated navigation option.
Key Features
Data-Driven Predictions:
Predict recruitment outcomes using six key features.
Real-Time Results:
Instant predictions with high accuracy.
User-Friendly Interface:
Simplified navigation with a sidebar for inputs and navigation.
Model Transparency:
Detailed information on the dataset and Random Forest model, including accuracy and methodology.
System Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
Required Python libraries:
streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
Installation and Setup
Clone this repository or download the project files.
Install the required Python libraries:
bash

Dataset Details
The app uses a dataset containing the following features:

Gender: Student's gender (Male/Female).
SSC Percentage: Secondary School Certificate percentage.
HSC Percentage: Higher Secondary Certificate percentage.
Degree Percentage: Undergraduate degree percentage.
E-Test Percentage: Aptitude test percentage.
MBA Percentage: MBA program percentage.
Status: Recruitment status (Placed/Not Placed).
Model Information
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
Accuracy: Achieved {accuracy * 100:.2f}% on test data.
Training:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20).
Features: Gender, SSC Percentage, HSC Percentage, Degree Percentage, E-Test Percentage, MBA Percentage.
Navigation Options
Predict Recruitment: Enter input data and receive recruitment predictions.
